Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project CodeBook
This file describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work performed to clean up the data.

The site where the data was obtained:
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

The data for the project:
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

The run_analysis.R script performs the following steps to clean the data:

1. Read X_train.txt, y_train.txt and subject_train.txt from the "./UCI HAR Dataset/train/" folder and Merge them in data frama train.
2. Read X_test.txt, y_test.txt and subject_test.txt from the "./UCI HAR Dataset/test" folder and Merge them in data frame test.
3. Combine the train en test dataset in a dataframe Total_dataset. And store a copy in the data frame CleanedData.
4. 
	a. Read the features.txt file from the "./UCI HAR Dataset/" folder and store the data in data frame features. 
        b. Use the data frame features to name the columns, also include the column names "activity" and "subject_id". 
	c. Make the columns names R-proof.
	c. Subset the data frame CleanedData with the columns subject_id, activity and the columns for measurements of the mean and standard deviation (68 columns).

5. Clean the column names of the subset. Remove the "." symbols and lowercase all the column names.
6. Read the activity_labels.txt file from the "./UCI HAR Dataset/" folder and store the data in data frame activity. There are 6 kinds of activity.
7. Clean the activity names in the second column of activity. Remove the underscores an lowercase the column names.
8. Transform the values of columns activity according to the activity data frame.
10.Write the cleanedData out to "CleanedData.txt" file in current working directory.
11.Create a second independent tidy data set with the average of each measurement for each activity and each subject. 
   Write the result out to "CleanedDataSummary.txt" file in current working directory.
